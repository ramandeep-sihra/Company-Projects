MDM & Supplier Tool Project
DB Schenker, London 2020-2022

I assisted in the creation, amendments to the processes on how the MDM & Supplier Tools work. I contributed towards meetings to understand how accounts are created and maintained in the MDM systems and also helped the Global team with any queries and validation of UK and Irish accounts. I attended and contributed towards the creation and launch of the supplier tools. By attending regular meetings conducting live tests of the new supplier system I was able to give feedback to the creator suggestions on how the system could be improved to improve efficiency when opening new vendor accounts for UK and Ireland
