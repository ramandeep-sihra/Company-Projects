# Company-Projects
Here you can find see two of my work projects.
1. The Finance Team KPI Project is a dashboard and report I created to investigate gaps in team training as we received compaints from branches on invoices coded incorrectly.
2. The Master Data Management (MDM) Project was lauched in 2020, where I contributed towards meetings and helped train team members on how to use the application.
